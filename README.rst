Emacs for Python
================

A modular Emacs configuration for Python developers.

Some Background
---------------

In a workshop during the PythonCamp 2011 in Cologne we've collected
some ideas for a modular and ready-to-use Python configuration for
Emacs.

Currently the ideas are available in an Etherpad:
http://openetherpad.org/pycamp-emacs


Getting Started
---------------

If you just want to test this Emacs configuration, run

.. sourcecode:: bash

  $ emacs -Q -l emacs-sample.el
