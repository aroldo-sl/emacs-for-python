Python Progamming Mode
======================

There are two Python programming modes for Emacs: :file:`python.el`
and :file:`python-mode.el`. The first comes bundled with Emacs, the
latter is part of the Python distribution. "Emacs for Python" provides
both.

To enable Python programming mode, add ``efp-feature-python-mode`` to your
list of features. This sets up the Python mode that comes with the
Python distribution. If you prefer to use the one that comes with
Emacs, set the option ``efp-python-mode`` to ``'pymode-builtin``.
