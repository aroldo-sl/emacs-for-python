Emacs for Python
================

A modular Emacs configuration for Python developers.

Some background
---------------

In a workshop during the PythonCamp 2011 in Cologne we've collected
some ideas for a modular and ready-to-use Python configuration for
Emacs.

Currently the ideas are available in an Etherpad:
